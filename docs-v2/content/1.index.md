<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Zoomifyjs is a lightweight (only 1kb gzipped) image zoom plugin with no dependencies and no styling. As Brad Frost once said "do that shit yourself". It is 100% open source and [available on Github](https://github.com/mrazinshaikh/zoomifyjs). It is free to use on personal and commercial projects. Use it with your favourite module bundler or by manually injecting the script into your project.
